                Match 53 of the IPL 2023 edition saw the two-time winners Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) take on the Punjab Kings (PBKS) at the iconic Eden Gardens, Kolkata on Monday evening (May 08). Opting to bat first, Shikhar Dhawan & Co. rode on the captain's 47-ball 57 and cameos from Harpreet Brar, Jitesh Sharma and Shahrukh Khan to post 179/7. In reply, Nitish Rana's KKR started well courtesy of Jason Roy's 24-ball 38 and were kept in the hunt courtesy of the skipper's 38-ball 51 before the finishing acts provided by Rinku Singh (21* off 10) and Andre Russell's 23-ball 42. With this win, KKR remain alive in the playoffs race and join as many as four more teams with ten points each. Powered By VDO.AI</p>

                <p>Rohit Sharma-led Mumbai Indians (MI) take on the Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) in match 54 of the IPL 2023 edition on Tuesday (May 09). At the eighth place in the points table, MI will be desperate to earn a win and keep their playoffs chances alive at the Wankede Stadium, Mumbai. For MI, their middle-order has done really well whereas none apart from Piyush Chawla has been consistent or very threatening with the ball. Talking about skipper Rohit</p></div>

When, while the lovely valley teems with vapour around me, and the meridian sun strikes the upper surface of the impenetrable foliage of my trees, and but a few stray gleams steal into the inner sanctuary, I throw myself down among the tall grass by the trickling stream; and, as I lie close to the earth, a thousand unknown plants are noticed by me: when I hear the buzz of the little world among the stalks</p></div>
            <div class="collumn"><div class="head"><span class="headline hl1">It wasn't a dream </span><p><span class="headline hl4">by FRANZ KAFKA</span></p></div><p>One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. </p>
                        
                        <p>His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked. "What's happened to me?" he thought. It wasn't a dream. His room, a proper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully between its four familiar walls. A collection of textile samples lay spread out on the table - Samsa was a travelling salesman - and above it there hung a picture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and housed in a nice, gilded frame. It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her lower arm towards the viewer. Gregor then turned to look out the window at the dull weather. </p></div>
